## **Installation** :computer:

For the elaboration of the  numerical methods before talked, it has been necessary to use MatLab, which offers us an integrated development with its own programming language. To download this software you can click [*here* ](https://es.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html?s_tid=gn_getml "Link Matlab").

Some of the functions that have been used on the codes were the followings ones: 
* The function `inline` is used to construct an inline function object from the expression.

```matlab
f = inline(fx);
```
* The function `abs` returns the absolute value of each element of the array *X*.
```matlab
Y = abs(X);
```
* The function `plot` creates a 2D line plot of the data in *Y* versus the values in *X* .
```matlab
plot(X,Y);
```
* The function`disp` show us a text on the screen.
```matlab
disp('The process was correct');
```
